Devel-NYTProf
=============

Devel::NYTProf is a powerful feature-rich perl source code profiler.

Devel::NYTProf was written and tested on Linux, Solaris and OS X.
Please report any problems you encounter on other platforms.
(Except for windows as we can't help you, but we'd love someone to port it for us.)
