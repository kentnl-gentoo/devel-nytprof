Devel-NYTProf version 0.08
==========================

The Devel::NYTProf bundle is a full featured perl line-by-line profiler and
profile report generator for Perl.  Devel::NYTProf provides an XS profiler.
The included Devel::NYTProf::Reader provides a flexible XS report generator 
for the profiler output.  Two scripts are also included which implement the
functionality of Devel::NYTProf::Reader.  The first is nytprof_csv, which
creates a comma-seperated value formatted report file.  It is simple and
intended to provide a jumping point into creating your own custom reports.
The second script is nytprof_html, which creates pretty multipage HTML 
reports.  Both scripts will be installed into your <perl-path>/bin
directory, so add that to your $PATH if you want.

Devel::NYTProf was written and tested on both Linux and Solaris.  Please 
report any problems you encounter on other platforms.  (...except Windows. 
I won't fix major Windows problems, but you're welcome to make a patch!)
