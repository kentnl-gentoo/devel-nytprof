	- Changed XS code to compile clean with -ansi and -pedantic
	- Removed `cont' on file argument to process due to XS error in Perl 5.6
	- Added code to Makefile.PL so that header sources are run through the C 
	  pre-processor (if availible) as a potential fix for some BSD systems.

0.03  Thu Mar 6 09:12:00 2008
	- Fixed a VERY tricky bug some people had encountered. Scalar references to 
			code that is evaled at runtime will cause divide-by-zero error IF the
			reference was declared in a BEGIN {...} and used outside of a BEGIN. 
			(The debugger/profiler can't see what happens in a BEGIN)
	- Added test case for above issue as test11
	- Fixed (i hope) the OSX segfault when using a re-malloc'd pointer that was 
			once freed.
	- Changed XS to compile cleanly with -Wall.
	- Adopted versioning scheme: modules/files start at 1.0 and the distro will
			continue from 0.0, thus making mixed versions less confusing.
	- Enabled the debugging switch so that NYTProf can be used in the form
			perl -MDevel::NYTProf code.pl (BUT this is ALPHA quality -- may bork)
	- Minor cleanup to Makefile.PL

0.02  Wed Mar 5 14:20:00 2008
	- fixed a bunch of minor problems with the distribution that caused cpan
		warnings and also cause the exe scripts to not be installed
	- now a working cpan distro

0.01  Tue Feb 12 10:34:03 2008
