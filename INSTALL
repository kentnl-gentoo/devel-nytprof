Devel::NYTProf Installation Notes
=================================

For the most part, users on Unix-like operating system can do:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module library tried to speed thing up when running in forkmode by using
fpruge() to delete potential duplicated buffers.  Unfortunately, althrough
fpurge() *is* in the GNU manual, operating systems largely implement it very
differently.  The Makefile.PL does some magic to find out where your particular
version of fpurge is.  Usually it can be found in stdio.h or stdio_ext.h, so
make sure those are in your INCLUDE path.  It is also sometimes named fpurge
_fpurge or __fpurge.

WINDOWS

Windows users are currently out of luck.  The module will not compile properly
due to file locking headers, and some other POSIX/GNU code being absent.  It
should be possible to port the module, but this has not yet been done.  Feel
free to do it.  Also, file paths throughout the module are assumed to use "/"
instead of Windows "\", and assumed that "/...." will start at the file system
root.  These things can also be pathed if you feel the urge.

COMPILE NOTES

The module was written to compile silently with -Wall -pedantic -ansi.  Some
warnings might be generated from methods like XS_blah.  These are in Perl
generated code and cannot be fixed by me.

If 'make test' fails on perl 5.6, it should be safe to force install it.
