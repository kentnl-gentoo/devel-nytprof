NYTProf is effectively two profilers in one: a statement profiler, and a
subroutine profiler.

=head2 Statement Profiling

The statement profiler measures the time between entering one perl statement
and entering the next. Whenever execution reaches a new statement, the time
since entering the previous statement is calculated and added to the time
associated with the line of the source file that the previous statement starts on.

By default the statement profiler also determines the first line of the current
block and the first line of the current statement, and accumulates times
associated with those. NYTProf is the only Perl profiler to perform block level
profiling.

Another innovation unique to NYTProf is automatic compensation for a problem
inherent in simplistic statement-to-statement timing. Consider a statement that
calls a subroutine and then performs some other work that doesn't execute new
statements, for example:

  foo(...) + mkdir(...);

In all other statement profilers the time spent in remainder of the expression
(mkdir in the example) will be recorded as having been spent I<on the last
statement executed in foo()>! Here's another example:

  while (<>) {
     ...
     1;
  }

After the first time around the loop, any further time spent evaluating the
condition (waiting for input in this example) would be be recorded as having
been spent I<on the last statement executed in the loop>!

NYTProf avoids these problems by intercepting the opcodes which indicate that
control is returning into some previous statement and adjusting the profile
accordingly.

The statement profiler naturally generates a lot of data which is streamed out
to a file in a very compact format. NYTProf takes care to not include the
measurement and writing overheads in the profile times (some profilers produce
'noisy' data due to periodic stdio flushing).

=head2 Subroutine Profiling

The subroutine profiler measures the time between entering a subroutine and
leaving it. It then increments a call count and accumulates the duration.
For each subroutine called, separate counts and durations are stored I<for each
location that called the subroutine>.

Subroutine entry is detected by intercepting the entersub opcode. Subroutine
exit is detected via perl's internal save stack. The result is both extremely
fast and very robust.

=head3 Subroutine Recursion

For subroutines that recurse directly or indirectly, such as Error::try,
the inclusive time is only measured for the outer-most call.

The inclusive times of recursive calls are still measured and are accumulated
separately. Also the 'maximum recursion depth' per calling location is recorded.

=head2 Application Profiling

NYTProf records extra information in the data file to capture details that may
be useful when analysing the performance. It also records the filename and line
ranges of all the subroutines.

NYTProf can profile applications that fork, and does so with no loss of
performance. There's (now) no special 'allowfork' mode. It just works.
NYTProf detects the fork and starts writing a new profile file with the pid
appended to the filename.

=head2 Fast Profiling

The NYTProf profiler is written almost entirely in C and great care has been
taken to ensure it's very efficient.

=head2 Apache Profiling

Just add one line near the start of your httpd.conf file:

  PerlModule Devel::NYTProf::Apache

By default you'll get a F</tmp/nytprof.$$.out> file for the parent process and
a F</tmp/nytprof.$parent.out.$$> file for each worker process.

NYTProf takes care to detect when control is returning back from perl to
mod_perl so time spent in mod_perl (such as waiting for the next request)
does not get allocated to the last statement executed.

Works with mod_perl 1 and 2. See L<Devel::NYTProf::Apache> for more information.

=head1 PROFILING

Usually you'd load Devel::NYTProf on the command line using the perl -d option:

  perl -d:NYTProf some_perl.pl

To save typing the ':NYTProf' you could set the PERL5DB env var 

  PERL5DB='use Devel::NYTProf'

and then just perl -d would work:

  perl -d some_perl.pl

Or you can avoid the need to add the -d option at all by using the C<PERL5OPT> env var:

  PERL5OPT=-d:NYTProf

That's also very handy when you can't alter the perl command line being used to
run the script you want to profile.

=head1 NYTPROF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

The behavior of Devel::NYTProf may be modified by setting the 
environment variable C<NYTPROF>.  It is possible to use this environment
variable to effect multiple setting by separating the values with a C<:>.  For
example:

  export NYTPROF=trace=2:start=init:file=/tmp/nytprof.out

Any colon or equal characters in a value can be escaped by preceeding them with
a backslash.

=head2 addpid=1

Append the current process id to the end of the filename.

This avoids concurrent, or consecutive, processes from overwriting the same file.

=head2 trace=N

Set trace level to N. 0 is off (the default). Higher values cause more detailed trace output.

=head2 start=...

Specify at which phase of program execution the profiler should be enabled:

  start=begin - start immediately (the default)
  start=init  - start at begining of INIT phase (after compilation)
  start=end   - start at begining of END phase
  start=no    - don't automatically start

The start=no option is handy if you want to explicitly control profiling
by calling DB::enable_profile() and DB::disable_profile() yourself.

=head2 optimize=0

Disable the perl optimizer.

By default NYTProf leaves perl's optimizer enabled.  That gives you more
accurate profile timing overall, but can lead to I<odd> statement counts for
individual sets of lines. That's because the perl's peephole optimizer has
effectively rewritten the statements but you can't see what the rewritten
version looks like.

For example:

  1     if (...) {
  2         return;
  3     }

may be rewritten as

  1    return if (...)

so the profile won't show a statement count for line 2 in your source code
because the C<return> was merged into the C<if> statement on the preceeding line.

Using the C<optimize=0> option disables the optimizer so you'll get lower
overall performance but more accurately assigned statement counts.

If you find any other examples of the effect of optimizer on NYTProf output
(other than performance, obviously) please let us know.

=head2 subs=0

Set to 0 to disable the collection of subroutine caller and timing details.

=head2 blocks=0

Set to 0 to disable the determination of block and subroutine location per statement.
This makes the profiler about 50% faster (as of July 2008) and produces smaller
output files, but you loose some valuable information. The extra cost is likely
to be reduced in later versions anyway, as little optimization has been done on
that part of the code.

=head2 stmts=0

Set to 0 to disable the statement profiler. (Implies C<blocks=0>.)
The reports won't contain any statement timing detail.

This significantly reduces the overhead of the profiler and can also be useful
for profiling large applications that would normally generate a very large
profile data file.

=head2 leave=0

Set to 0 to disable the extra work done to allocate times accurately when
returning into the middle of statement. For example leaving a subroutine
and returning into the middle of statement, or re-evaluting a loop condition.

This feature also ensures that in embedded environments, such as mod_perl,
the last statement executed doesn't accumulate the time spent 'outside perl'.

NYTProf is the only line-level profiler to measure these times correctly.
The profiler is fast enough that you shouldn't need to disable this feature.

=head2 use_db_sub=1

Set to 1 to enable use of the traditional DB::DB() subroutine to perform
profiling, instead of the faster 'opcode redirection' technique that's used by
default. Also effectively sets C<leave=0> (see above).

The default 'opcode redirection' technique can't profile subroutines that were
compiled before NYTProf was loaded. So using use_db_sub=1 can be useful in
cases where you can't load the profiler early in the life of the application.

=head2 savesrc=1

Save a copy of all source code into the profile data file. This makes the file
self-contained, so the reporting tools no longer depend on having the original
source code files available. So it also insulates you from later changes to
those files that would normally make the reports out of sync with the data.

By default NYTProf saved some source code: the arguments to the C<perl -e>
option, the script fed to perl via STDIN when using C<perl ->, and the source
code of string evals. (Currently string eval  source code isn't available in
the reports. Patches welcome.)

If you're using perl 5.10.0 or 5.8.8 (or earlier) then you need to also enable
the C<use_db_sub=1> option otherwise perl doesn't make the source code
available to NYTProf. Perl 5.8.9 and 5.10.1+ don't require that.

=head2 usecputime=1

Measure user CPU + system CPU time instead of the real elapsed 'wall clock'
time (which is the default).

Measuring CPU time has the advantage of making the measurements independant of
time spent blocked waiting for the cpu or network i/o etc. But it also has the
severe disadvantage of having typically I<far> less accurate timings.

Most systems use a 0.01 second granularity. With modern processors having multi-
gigahertz clocks, 0.01 seconds is like a lifetime. The cpu time clock 'ticks'
happen so rarely relative to the activity of a most applications that you'd
have to run the code for many hours to have any hope of reasonably useful results.

A better alternative would be to use the C<clock=N> option to select a
high-resolution cpu time clock, if available on your system.

=head2 file=...

Specify the output file to write profile data to (default: './nytprof.out').

=head2 compress=...

Specify the compression level to use, if NYTProf is compiled with compression
support. Valid values are 0 to 9, with 0 disabling compression. The default is
6 as higher values yield little extra compression but the cpu cost starts to
rise significantly. Using level 1 still gives you a significant reduction in file size.

If NYTProf was not compiled with compression support, this option is silently ignored.

=head2 clock=N

Systems which support the C<clock_gettime()> system call typically
support several clocks. By default NYTProf uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

This option enables you to select a different clock by specifying the
integer id of the clock (which may vary between operating system types).
If the clock you select isn't available then CLOCK_REALTIME is used.

See L</CLOCKS> for more information.

=head1 RUN-TIME CONTROL OF PROFILING

You can profile only parts of an application by calling DB::disable_profile()
to stop collecting profile data, and calling DB::enable_profile() to start
collecting profile data.

Using the C<start=no> option lets you leave the profiler disabled initially
until you call DB::enable_profile() at the right moment.

The profile output file can't be used until it's been properly completed and
closed.  Calling DB::disable_profile() doesn't do that.  To make a profile file
usable before the profiled application has completed you can call
DB::finish_profile(). Alternatively you could call DB::enable_profile($newfile).

=head2 DB::disable_profile()

Stops collection of profile data.

Subroutine calls which were made while profiling was enabled and are still on
the call stack (have not yet exited) will still have their profile data
collected when they exit.

=head2 DB::enable_profile($newfile)

Enables collection of profile data. If $newfile is true the profile data will be
written to $newfile (after completing and closing the previous file, if any).
If $newfile already exists it will be deleted first.

=head2 DB::finish_profile()

Calls DB::disable_profile(), then completes the profile data file by writing
subroutine profile data, and then closes the file. The in memory subroutine
profile data is then discarded.

=head1 REPORTS

The L<Devel::NYTProf::Data> module provides a low-level interface for loading
the profile data.

The L<Devel::NYTProf::Reader> module provides an interface for generating
arbitrary reports.  This means that you can implement your own output format in
perl. (Though the module is in a state of flux and may be deprecated soon.)

Included in the bin directory of this distribution are two scripts
which implement the L<Devel::NYTProf::Reader> interface: 

=over 12

=item nytprofcsv

creates comma delimited profile reports

=item nytprofhtml

creates attractive, richly annotated, and fully cross-linked html
reports (including statistics, source code and color highlighting)

=back

=head1 CLOCKS

Here we discuss the way NYTProf gets high-resolution timing information from
your system and related issues.

=head2 POSIX Clocks

These are the clocks that your system may support if it supports the POSIX
C<clock_gettime()> function. Other clock sources are listed in the
L</Other Clocks> section below.

The C<clock_gettime()> interface allows clocks to return times to nanosecond
precision. Of course few offer nanosecond I<accuracy> but the extra precision
helps reduce the cumulative error that naturally occurs when adding together
many timings. When using these clocks NYTProf outputs timings as a count of 100
nanosecond ticks.

=head3 CLOCK_REALTIME

CLOCK_REALTIME is typically the system's main high resolution 'wall clock time'
source.  The same source as used for the gettimeofday() call used by most kinds
of perl benchmarking and profiling tools.

If your system doesn't support clock_gettime() then NYTProf will use
gettimeofday(), or the nearest equivalent,

The problem with real time is that it's far from simple. It tends to drift and
then be reset to match 'reality', either sharply or by small adjustments (via the
adjtime() system call).

Surprizingly, it can also go backwards, for reasons explained in
http://preview.tinyurl.com/5wawnn

=head3 CLOCK_MONOTONIC

CLOCK_MONOTONIC rrepresents the amount of time since an unspecified point in
the past (typically system start-up time).  It increments uniformally
independent of adjustments to 'wallclock time'.

=head3 CLOCK_VIRTUAL

CLOCK_VIRTUAL increments only when the CPU is running in user mode on behalf of the calling process.

=head3 CLOCK_PROF

CLOCK_PROF increments when the CPU is running in user I<or> kernel mode.

=head3 CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID

CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID represents the amount of execution time of the process associated with the clock.

=head3 CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID

CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID represents the amount of execution time of the thread associated with the clock.

=head3 Finding Available POSIX Clocks

On unix-like systems you can find the CLOCK_* clocks available on you system
using a command like:

  grep -r 'define *CLOCK_' /usr/include

Look for a group that includes CLOCK_REALTIME. The integer values listed are
the clock ids that you can use with the C<clock=N> option.

A future version of NYTProf should be able to list the supported clocks.

=head2 Other Clocks

This section lists other clock sources that NYTProf may use.

=head3 gettimeofday

This is the traditional high resolution time of day interface for most
unix-like systems. It's used on platforms like Mac OS X which don't
(yet) support C<clock_gettime()>.

With this clock NYTProf outputs timings as a count of 1 microsecond ticks.

=head3 Time::HiRes

On systems which don't support C<clock_gettime()> or C<gettimeofday()>
NYTProf falls back to using the L<Time::HiRes> module.
With this clock NYTProf outputs timings as a count of 1 microsecond ticks.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=head2 threads

C<Devel::NYTProf> is not currently thread safe. If you'd be interested in
helping to make it thread safe then please get in touch with us.

=head2 For perl < 5.8.8 it may change what caller() returns

For example, the L<Readonly> module croaks with "Invalid tie" when profiled with
perl versions before 5.8.8. That's because L<Readonly> explicitly checking for
certain values from caller(). The L<NEXT> module is also affected.

=head2 For perl < 5.10.1 it can't see calls made via operator overloading

For perl versions prior to 5.8.9 and 5.10.1, calls made via operator
overloading are not noticed by the I<subroutine> profiler.  Though the
statements executed by the code in the overload subs are profiled.

The effect is that time in the subroutines that handle overloading is
accumulated by any subroutines that trigger overloading (so it is measured,
but the cost is dispersed across possibly many calling locations).

=head2 goto

The C<goto &foo;> isn't recognised as a subroutine call by the subroutine profiler.

=head2 Calls to XSubs which exit via an exception

Calls to XSubs which exit via an exception are not recorded by subroutine profiler.

=head2 #line directives

The reporting code currently doesn't handle #line directives, but at least it
warns about them. Patches welcome.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 SMP Systems

Systems with multiple processors, which includes most modern machines, have

From Linux docs (though applicable to most SMP systems):

  The CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks are realized on
  many platforms using timers from the CPUs (TSC on i386, AR.ITC on Itanium).
  These registers may differ between CPUs and as a consequence these clocks may
  return bogus results if a process is migrated to another CPU.

  If the CPUs in an SMP system have different clock sources then there is no way
  to maintain a correlation between the timer registers since each CPU will run
  at a slightly different frequency. If that is the case then
  clock_getcpuclockid(0) will return ENOENT to signify this condition. The two
  clocks will then only be useful if it can be ensured that a process stays on a
  certain CPU.

  The processors in an SMP system do not start all at exactly the same time and
  therefore the timer registers are typically running at an offset. Some
  architectures include code that attempts to limit these offsets on bootup.
  However, the code cannot guarantee to accurately tune the offsets. Glibc
  contains no provisions to deal with these offsets (unlike the Linux Kernel).
  Typically these offsets are small and therefore the effects may be negligible
  in most cases.

In summary, SMP systems are likely to give 'noisy' profiles.
Setting a L<Processor Affinity> may help.

=head3 Processor Affinity

Processor affinity is an aspect of task scheduling on SMP systems.
"Processor affinity takes advantage of the fact that some remnants of a process
may remain in one processor's state (in particular, in its cache) from the last
time the process ran, and so scheduling it to run on the same processor the
next time could result in the process running more efficiently than if it were
to run on another processor." (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity)

Setting an explicit processor affinity can avoid the problems described in
L</SMP Systems>.

Processor affinity can be set using the C<taskset> command on Linux.

Future versions of NYTProf could support setting processor affinity automatically
(e.g. via sched_setaffinity() on Linux). Patches welcome!

Note that processor affinity is inherited by child processes, so if the process
you're profiling spawns cpu intensive sub processes then your process will be
impacted by those more than it otherwise would.

=head2 Virtual Machines

I recommend you don't do performance profiling while running in a
virtual machine.  If you do you're likely to find inexplicable spikes
of real-time appearing at unreasonable places in your code. You should pay
less attention to the statement timings and rely more on the subroutine
timings. They will still be noisy but less so than the statement times.

You could also try using the C<clock=N> option to select a high-resolution
I<cpu-time> clock instead of a real-time one. That should be much less
noisy, though you will loose visibility of wait-times due to network
and disk I/O, for example.

If your system doesn't support the C<clock=N> option then you could try
using the C<usecputime=1> option. That will give you cpu-time measurements
but only at a very low 1/100th of a second resolution.

=head1 BUGS

A bit of history and a shameless plug...

NYTProf stands for 'New York Times Profiler'. Indeed, this module was initially
developed from Devel::FastProf by The New York Times Co. to help our developers
quickly identify bottlenecks in large Perl applications.  The NY Times loves
Perl and we hope the community will benefit from our work as much as we have
from theirs.

Devel::NYTProf is a (now distant) fork of Devel::FastProf, which was itself an
evolution of Devel::SmallProf.

Adam Kaplan took Devel::FastProf and added html report generation (based on
Devel::Cover) and a test suite - a tricky thing to do for a profiler.
Meanwhile Tim Bunce had been extending Devel::FastProf to add novel
per-sub and per-block timing, plus subroutine caller tracking.

When Devel::NYTProf was released Tim switched to working on Devel::NYTProf
because the html report would be a good way to show the extra profile data, and
the test suite made development much easier and safer.

Then he went a little crazy and added a slew of new features, in addition to
per-sub and per-block timing and subroutine caller tracking. These included the
'opcode interception' method of profiling, ultra-fast and robust inclusive
subroutine timing, doubling performance, plus major changes to html reporting
to display all the extra profile call and timing data in richly annotated and
cross-linked reports.

Steve Peters came on board along the way with patches for portability and to
keep NYTProf working with the latest development perl versions. Nicholas Clark
